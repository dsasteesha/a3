# Acquired
Acquired is a web-based platform specifically designed for college students, offering a secure and convenient marketplace for buying, selling, or exchanging items typically used during their time in college. Unlike broader marketplace competitors such as OfferUp, Facebook Marketplace, or eBay, Acquired focuses exclusively on the college student demographic, creating a more targeted and trusted community. By limiting the user base to verified college students, Acquired ensures a safer, more relevant platform for exchanging goods. This not only provides students with the opportunity to profit from items that would otherwise be discarded but also fosters a localized and reliable marketplace experience within the student community.
